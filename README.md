This repository contains agnostic datasets that can be loaded into various database systems. Those datasets are loaded into the https://agx.app instance.



### Datasets List

See [here](datasets.md).

### Prerequisites

- A running instance of your preferred database (agx, Clickhouse, etc.)
- Ability to execute SQL commands on your database

### Usage with agx

1. Open agx (native)
2. Drag and drop the dataset file into the agx interface
3. Run the query

## Contributing

Please feel free to submit pull requests to add more datasets or improve existing ones.

### Generated SQL files

Some of the `SQL` are generated by Python scripts and so it the `dataset.md` file.
The general pattern is that a Python script named `generate.py` will  generate some files 
based on `Jinja2` templates (and optionally some `YAML` config files).
These files must be commited, so every time you modify either a `generate.py` file (or a accampgning config file), 
you must run the script to regenerate the output files.

Generate scripts must declare their dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file at the repository
root.

You must first create a `virtualenv`:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then to run generate scripts:

```sh
python generate.py
python eth_panda_ops/xatu/generate.py
```
